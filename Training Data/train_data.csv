kremer virus researcher the institute molecular genetics montpellier france health officials more than dozen countries look into the mystery they are asking has there been some surge the stomach bug called adenovirus that causing more cases previously undetected problem are children more susceptible due pandemicrelated lockdowns that sheltered them from the viruses kids usually experience there some mutated version the adenovirus causing this some other notyetidentified germ drug toxin some kind haywire immune system reaction set off past covid19 infection and later invasion some other virus the centers for disease control and prevention and investigators around the globe are trying sort out whats going the illnesses are considered rare cdc officials last week said they are now looking into possible cases across the most the children were hospitalized least required liver transplants and six died more than other countries have reported hundreds more cases total though the largest

causes liver inflammation otherwise healthy kids the viruses known hepatitis and didnt show tests what’s more the children came from different places and there seemed common exposures what did show was adenovirus more than half the cases have tested positive for adenovirus which there are dozens varieties small number specimens tested see what kind adenovirus was present adenovirus came every time the fact that adenovirus keeps showing strengthens the case for playing role but its unclear how jay butler the cdc’s deputy director for infectious diseases told the associated press many adenoviruses are associated with common cold symptoms such fever sore throat and pink eye some versions including adenovirus can trigger other problems including inflammation the stomach and

adenoviruses are common that researchers arent sure what make their presence these cases “if start testing everybody for the adenovirus they will find many kids” that have said heli bhatt pediatric

illnesses but rather earlier ones that were reevaluated about the cases occurred may butler said the rate seems relatively flat since the fall added its possible that doctors are merely discovering phenomenon thats been going for years some scientists said covid19 vaccination has been ruled out because the vast majority these children are unvaccinated” butler explained but past infection with the coronavirus itself might factor scientists say the cdc recently estimated that february children had been infected only the children with the mysterious hepatitis had covid19 according nasal swab tests given when they checked into hospital health officials say but investigators are wondering about previous coronavirus infections its possible that coronavirus particles lurking the gut are playing role said petter brodin pediatric immunologist imperial college london piece earlier this month the medical journal lancet brodin and another scientist suggested that combination lingering
